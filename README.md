# Machine_Learning_and_Deep_Learning_Project:-
## *- In this Project Section i have put several Project using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Concept. So here is a brief information about Project and work strategy.*


# * *Machine Learning project :-*
## 1. Walmart Sales Prediction:- 
*In this Project I have extract dataset from 'Kaggle' and used some Machine learning algorithms to predict the future sales of Walmart Store. Also checking the best accuracy and then using it for final Prediction.*

## 2. Wine Classification :-
*In this Project downloaded dataset from 'kaggle' and with the help of some relevant available features trying to predict the Category of wine whether it's Red or White.*

# * *Deep Learning project :-*
## 1. Facial Landmark Detection:-
*In this Project I have used OpenCV and other libraries like dlib. Also tried to Detect the facial landmarks using these libraries.*
